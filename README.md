# Home Credit Default Risk Analysis

## Overview
The **Home Credit Default Risk Analysis** project aims to enhance financial inclusion by predicting loan repayment capabilities for individuals with limited or no credit history. Using alternative data, we developed a supervised machine learning model to evaluate creditworthiness and provide actionable insights for lenders.

## Business Problem
Financial institutions often rely on traditional credit scores, which can exclude individuals lacking credit history. This project focuses on creating a predictive model that utilizes alternative data sources, enabling informed lending decisions and expanding opportunities for both borrowers and lenders.

## Objectives
- Develop a predictive model to evaluate loan default risk.
- Increase loan approval rates while maintaining or reducing lender risk.
- Provide business insights to drive data-informed decision-making.

## Data and Methodology
- **Data Sources:** Provided datasets include demographic, transactional, and telco data.
- **EDA:** Explored trends, identified missing values, and performed data preprocessing.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created new variables to enhance predictive performance.
- **Modeling:** Built and fine-tuned a logistic regression classifier to predict loan defaults.
- **Visualization:** Generated insightful plots to communicate findings effectively.

## Key Contributions
This notebook includes:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analysis of key patterns and trends in the data.
- **Feature Engineering:** Detailed feature transformations to improve model accuracy.
- **Model Development:** Training and evaluation of the predictive model.
- **Results Interpretation:** Business value insights derived from the analysis.

## Business Impact
By leveraging this model, lenders can:
- Approve more loans for individuals with limited credit history.
- Enhance profitability by reducing default rates and expanding the client base.
- Support financial inclusion initiatives for underserved populations.
